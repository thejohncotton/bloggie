-Pros:
- The massive aount of regen makes it difficult for the enemy to constantly harass you.
- Large amount of right click damage with a quelling blade so last hits are easy.
- Gaining fast levels allows you to rotate to give more space for your core and he can build virtually anything and still be a viable mid laner.

-Cons:
- One of the slowest heros in the game.
- Not capable of man fighting before level 6 against most heros.
- Low armor

There's never going to be a universally agreed method on the mid lane pudge, but it has proper advantages and disadvantages. If you truly believe you can out farm the enemy in the lane, you can definitely make an impact throughout your game. If you believe you can't, your hero still has the capabilities of forcing your enemy into positions they do not wish to take, I.E. - Hooking a sven into your shrine and using the shrine for bonus armor to allow your team a quick pick off.

Overall the hero is good about 80% of the time. But in the end it's completely up to you.

Below i'll name off some good items and explain what their purpose is as well as if it's situational or should be everytime.

| Name | Cost | Purpose | Situational |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Bracer | 515 | Good early stats and magic resist for the rot self damage | No
| Phase Boots | 1400 | Armor + phasing through creeps when rotting | No |
| Urn of Shadows | 875 | To gain an additional damage item during your rot dismember combo or chasing for a dot kill, or possibly using it to heal yourself when you need to turn and rot dismember as the rot no longer breaks it | No
| Guardian Greaves | 8700 | Healing, Armor, Removal of debuffs like silences on yourself and roots | Yes |
| Pipe of Insight | 3870 | Negating some magic damage and giving yourself and your team more magic resistance | Yes

As a **mid pudge**, you want to think of yourself as a tanky hero who can't die so easily as ontop of that you can just front line with no issues like tidehunter. And as well as that, by buying **utility** items, you give your entire team sustain without throwing away your pudge because at the end of the day, all you are is just a hook rot dismember. And then you run around in a circle with rot. So by allowing yourself and your team to live longer in the fight you give yourself a higher chance of winning the fights.
